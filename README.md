# LarryCS
LarryCS is an asynchronous dictionary-search engine that runs in your terminal using [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console). It is depending on the [DictionaryApi](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). HEAVILY inspired by [larryc](https://github.com/furtidev/larryc). Thanks to the Developers of the original program [furtidev](https://github.com/furtidev) & [HitBlast](https://github.com/hitblast) who inspired me a lot.

# Installation & Usage 
- Download the program from this GitHub repository
- run using `dotnet run`
- type a word
- Voila!

# IMPORTANT
This program is on a very early stage and just has been started getting developed recently. It DOES NOT have a polished UI & may have quite a few bugs. As time progresses, I will add more and more feature and a very pleasing UI.
