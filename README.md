# LarryCS
LarryCS is an asynchronous dictionary-search engine that runs in your terminal using [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console). It is depending on the [DictionaryApi](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). HEAVILY inspired by [larryc](https://github.com/furtidev/larryc). Thanks to the Developers of the original program [furtidev](https://github.com/furtidev) & [HitBlast](https://github.com/hitblast) who inspired me a lot.
